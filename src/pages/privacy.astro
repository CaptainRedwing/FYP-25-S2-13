        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: August, 2025</p>
        <p>Last Updated: July 30, 2025</p>

        <p><em>At VulnEye, your privacy is not just a feature &mdash; it's a principle.</em></p>

        <p>
            We believe security should be a right, not a luxury, and that includes your right to browse privately.
            VulnEye is built from the ground up to respect your privacy, and we're committed to full transparency in how the extension works.
        </p>

        <h3>1. No Data Collection. No Tracking</h3>
        <p>
            VulnEye does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing history.
            All scans and analysis are performed <strong>entirely client-side</strong> &mdash; within your browser. Nothing is sent to external servers.
        </p>

        <h3>2. No Cookies. No Analytics.</h3>
        <p>We don't use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tracking cookies</li>
            <li>Analytics scripts</li>
            <li>Fingerprinting technologies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your usage of the extension is entirely anonymous.</p>

        <h3>3. Open Source Transparency</h3>
        <p>
            Our source code is fully available on <a href="https://github.com/ilovecoding77/FYP-25-S2-13" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.<br />
            You're free to inspect how VulnEye works, contribute to the PromiseRejectionEvent, or fork Iterator.<br />
            We believe open-source tools are more trustworthy because they can be openly reviewed.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Permissions We Use</h3>
        <p>To function properly, VulnEye may request browser permissions such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access to the current tab (for scanning)</li>
            <li>Reading content of the page (for XSS/CSRF/header checks)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These permissions are used <strong>solely</strong> to analyze pages you're visiting and are not used to store, share, or exfiltrate data.</p>

        <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>
            VulnEye does not rely on third-party APIs, trackers, or CDNs.<br />
            Even updates and enhancements are pushed through your browser's extension manager or open-source repositories.
        </p>

        <h3>6. User Contributions & Donations</h3>
        <p>
            If you choose to donate or contribute (e.g., via GitHub or our support page), those platforms may collect data on their own terms. <br />
            We do not store or process any payment or personal information ourselves. <br />
            Please refer to those third-party platforms' policies (e.g., Stripe, GitHub) for more details.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Changes to this Policy</h3>
        <p>
            We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect minor changes or clarifications. <br />
            When we do, we'll revise the "Last Updated" date and clearly note any significant changes.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Contact</h3>
